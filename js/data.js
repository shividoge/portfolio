      <p>
        A fully autonomous plant growth platform designed for reliability, clarity,
        and long-term operation — not demos.
      </p>

      <h4>What it does</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time monitoring of plant health using environmental sensing</li>
        <li>Closed-loop control for autonomous environmental adaptation</li>
        <li>24/7 operation with minimal human intervention</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How I built it</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a custom PCB integrating nitrogen, oxygen, and temperature sensors</li>
        <li>Used a Teensy microcontroller for high-speed, reliable data acquisition</li>
        <li>Implemented a multi-camera computer vision system tracking root, stem, and canopy growth</li>
        <li>Integrated a dual-reservoir irrigation system to ensure continuous nutrient flow</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Achieved <strong>98% data accuracy</strong> in plant health monitoring</li>
        <li>Reduced manual maintenance time by <strong>80%+</strong></li>
        <li>Prototyped <strong>10+ system iterations</strong> in one month</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Human note:</em> I designed this system so someone else could run it confidently — not just so it worked on my desk.</p>

      <p>
        Robotics is where I learned how to ship real systems under pressure:
        deadlines, failures, integration issues, and team dynamics included.
      </p>

      <h4>Leadership</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>President of Middleton High School Robotics, overseeing <strong>9 teams</strong> across FRC, FTC, and VEX</li>
        <li>Mentored and managed <strong>100+ students</strong>, increasing participation and retention by <strong>30%</strong></li>
        <li>Organized <strong>15+ regional competitions</strong> across Florida</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Technical focus</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Led mechanical design for FTC Team #3846</li>
        <li>Developed two FTC robots ranked in the <strong>top 5% statewide</strong> for offensive power</li>
        <li>Led FTC Teams 1369 and 26588 to <strong>state qualification</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Revitalized the school’s FRC program after years of inactivity</li>
        <li>Earned <strong>2 national awards</strong> and <strong>1 World Championship award</strong></li>
        <li>Delivered the most successful season in program history</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Human note:</em> My favorite part isn’t winning — it’s watching someone realize they’re capable of more than they thought.</p>
